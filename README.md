# Matplotlib with Numpy and Pandas


## What is Matplotlib??

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

## Why Matplotlib??

One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends. Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means we can count on it to work regardless of which operating system we are using or which output format we wish. This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib. It has led to a large user base, which in turn has led to an active developer base and Matplotlib’s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python world.
